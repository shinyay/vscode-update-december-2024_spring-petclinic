> Use Copilot Edits to start an AI-powered code editing session where you can quickly iterate on code changes by using natural language. Based on your prompts, Copilot Edits proposes code changes across multiple files in your workspace. These edits are applied directly in the editor, so you can quickly review them in-place, with the full context of the surrounding code.

#### Move chat session to Copilot Edits

1. Open Copilot Chat (`Ctrl` + `Alt` + `I`)

2. Input the following prompt with `Owner.java`:

   ```text
   @workspace Please let me know the classes related Owner class. And also I want to add age field to Owner class.
   ```

   If GitHub Copilot mentioned only `Owner.java`, you should input the additional prompt:

   ```text
   What about controller classes? How should I modify them
   ```
